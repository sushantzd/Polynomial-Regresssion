# Polynomial-Regresssion
Polynomial Regression on Prepared Dataset

In this project, I prepared a dataset for regression tasks using scikit-learn and implemented Polynomial Regression to model the relationship between the features and the target variable.

Key steps in this project include:

* Data Preparation: Preprocessed and cleaned the dataset to ensure it was suitable for regression.

* Polynomial Feature Transformation: Transformed the input features into polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships.

* Polynomial Regression: Applied polynomial regression using scikit-learn's PolynomialFeatures and LinearRegression to fit the model and predict the target variable.

* Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model using metrics such as R-squared to measure the fit and performance.

This project demonstrates the use of polynomial regression for solving non-linear regression problems, showcasing the power of transforming input features to achieve better predictions.
